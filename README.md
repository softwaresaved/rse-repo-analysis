# RSE Repository Analysis

Study of research software in repositories. Contact: @karacolada

## Aim and Methodology

We want to investigate how research software projects have changed over time and differ between disciplines by analysing relevant software repositories.
This will help us gain a better understanding of ongoing processes in the research software community and of how they can be supported.

We consider multiple approaches to finding relevant software repositories:
- existing datasets about software mentions in research (e.g. [CZI Software Mentions](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/software-mentions), [Softcite Dataset](https://github.com/howisonlab/softcite-dataset))
- crawling publicly available publications for in-text Git(Hub) links (e.g. [ePrints](https://www.eprints.org/uk/))

Potentially interesting data points:
- licence
- team size
- commit frequency
- linkage to other research outputs
- topic
- maintenance time
- engagement (forks, stars, watchers)
